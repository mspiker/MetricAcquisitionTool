# Metric Acquisition Tool
## Project Overview
App to acquire collect and aggregate metrics to track an organization's performance. Data is entered manually or acquired from Power BI automatically on a schedule. 
The software app is designed to collect and aggregate key metrics relevant to an organization's performance. It systematically gathers data from various sources within the organization, such as patient quality metrics, customer satisfaction scores, work load units, or project completion rates. These metrics are then processed and organized within the app to generate comprehensive reports and charts that showcase the organization's performance across different areas using Microsoft Power BI.

The primary purpose of this app is to facilitate the submission of these metrics to populate an organization scorecard. The scorecard serves as a visual representation of the organization's overall health and progress towards strategic objectives. By automating the collection and reporting of metrics, the app enables stakeholders to easily monitor performance trends, identify areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions.

Key features of the software app include dashboards, real-time data updates, integration with Microsoft Fabric using DAX, and the ability to set targets and track progress against goals. Ultimately, the app aims to streamline the process of metric collection and scorecard creation, empowering organizations to better understand their performance and drive continuous improvement.
